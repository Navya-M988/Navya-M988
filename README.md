“Explain the workflow and process in your company.”

You can speak this exactly in your interview.

⭐ Interview Answer: Workflow & Process in My Company

“In my company, we follow an Agile Scrum process with 2-week sprint cycles.
Our workflow usually happens in these steps:

1. Requirement Gathering & Grooming

The Product Owner shares user stories in Jira (or project tool).

We attend grooming sessions to understand the functionality.

Discuss acceptance criteria, dependencies, and clarifications.

2. Sprint Planning

Stories are prioritized for the sprint.

Each team member estimates story points.

Testing scope and automation feasibility are identified.

3. Designing Test Scenarios & Test Cases

Based on user stories and acceptance criteria:

Prepare test scenarios

Prepare manual test cases

Identify regression test cases

Mark what can be automated

Test cases are reviewed internally.

4. Test Environment Setup

Build is deployed to QA/UAT environment

We check environment stability

Configurations, test data, and credentials are prepared

5. Manual Testing

We perform:

Functional testing

UI testing

Regression testing

Integration testing

API testing

End-to-end flow verification

Defects are logged in Jira with:

Steps to reproduce

Screenshots

Priority & severity

Logs/screens recordings if needed

6. Automation Testing

Parallel to manual testing, I automate:

High priority regression test cases

Repetitive flows

API validations

Cross-module scenarios

Tools I used:

RepFabric CRM → Selenium + Java + TestNG (POM framework)

ShadowCaster → Katalon Studio (Hybrid + Custom Keywords + Data-Driven)

Automation scripts are reviewed and merged with version control (Git).

7. Daily Scrum Meetings

Share yesterday’s work

Plan for today

Discuss blockers

Prioritize defect fixes with developers

8. Retesting & Regression

After dev fixes, we do:

Retesting

Full or partial regression suite execution

Automation regression if needed

9. Test Reporting

I prepare and share:

Daily status reports

Defect summary

Sprint-wise test execution report

Automation execution report (if run in Jenkins)

10. Sprint Review & Retrospective

Demonstration of new functionalities

Discuss what went well and what needs improvement

Plan process improvements for next sprint

⭐ Short 20-Second Version (If Interviewer Wants Brief Answer)

“We follow an Agile Scrum process. We start with requirement grooming, then sprint planning. I prepare test scenarios, test cases, and identify automation candidates. After development, I perform functional, regression, and API testing, raise defects, and run automation scripts. We have daily stand-ups, test reporting, defect tracking, and sprint reviews. Automation and manual testing happen in parallel, and we deliver a stable build at the end of each sprint.”
